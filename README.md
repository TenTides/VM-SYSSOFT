To properly run or vm, the file must be properly 
compliled first by executing gcc -o vm vm.c.

Thereafter, input files can be passed through the vm as
command line arugments at runtime. The format to do so can 
be seen below:

$ ./vm input.txt

*not passing an input file will result in a segmentation fault*
