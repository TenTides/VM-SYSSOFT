To properly run or vm, the file must be properly 
compliled first. Use "gcc -g vm.c" 
to generate a file from the vm.c file to run.

Thereafter, input files can be passed through the vm as
command line arugments at runtime. The format to do so can 
be seen below:

$ ./a.out input.txt

During runtime, insert any required numbers until 
the program reaches EOP command and halts.

*not passing an input file will result in a segmentation fault*
